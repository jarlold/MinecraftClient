## My Custom Minecraft Client
Here are some exploits for Minecraft I put together a while ago. These aren't 0-days or anything, they're fairly well known
vulnerabilities that have been in the game for years.

Don't use this to cheat on other people's server, that's not cool.
Do use this to further develop an understanding of cyber-security, and how exploits work in computer games.


## Where's the Minecraft code?
I can't distribute the Minecraft source code, as that would be a violation of copyright laws. This is the additional package
I've added to the game in order to test various security features of the Vanilla server. It contains the UI, keybind, and exploits
that affect the game. Inside each class there are comments indicating how to tie this into the original games source code.

If you would like to play with the source code yourself, you will need to decompile the game using a tool such as [MCP](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Programs_and_editors/Mod_Coder_Pack)
or [MCPReborn](https://github.com/Hexeption/MCP-Reborn).


## What's the practical use for this
There is no practical use, it's just fun.
